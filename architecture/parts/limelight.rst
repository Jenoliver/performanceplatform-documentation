Limelight was the first version of the frontend rendering for the Performance Platform. It helped us to understand more about the needs we were trying to meet, and go fast in testing ideas.

Currently it still provides the dashboards for the Licensing application part of GOV.UK, but all of the other functionality has been reimplemented in :ref:`Spotlight`.
