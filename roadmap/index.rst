Roadmap
#######

This will sketch out how the platform is intended to evolve and what our immediate objectives are.

It is an attempt to predict the future, so it will be wrong.

It is also public, which is interesting on another level. When solving problems, it's always fun to record:

* what your assumptions are
* what your objectives are
* how that changes as:
    * you learn more about the problem you're trying to solve
    * the problem itself changes

Hopefully the lessons learned from doing this experiment (it doesn't have to be public, but this is an experiment) will be beneficial from a personal development perspective.
