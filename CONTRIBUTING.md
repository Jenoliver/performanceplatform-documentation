## Key branches

- `gh-pages` is the hosted documentation

## Pull requests

- Try to submit pull requests against the latest `master` branch for easier merging
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes -- keep them simple and small

## Coding standards: HTML

- Two spaces for indentation, never tabs
- Double quotes only, never single quotes
- Always use proper indentation
- Use tags and elements appropriate for an HTML5 doctype, eg self-closing tags

## Commit hygiene

Please see our [git style guide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md)
