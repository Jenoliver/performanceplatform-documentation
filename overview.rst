Overview
########

The `Performance Platform <https://www.gov.uk/performance>`_ is a tool that shows you how your service is performing and how it can be improved. Services like `applying for a passport <https://www.gov.uk/apply-renew-passport>`_, `paying your car tax <https://www.gov.uk/tax-disc>`_, and `claiming state pension <https://www.gov.uk/claim-state-pension-online>`_.

The tool does the hard work to make data collection and presentation simple for the right people, at the right time, in the right way. 

The Government Digital Service (GDS) is putting all the government's performance data in one place, so you can easily see all the relevant information about a service in a single location.

Service managers can spot problems and then make improvements quickly. If you’re responsible for a public service, the Performance Platform could be the most helpful tool you have for finding out headline facts quickly, without having to ask.

GDS is giving each service a ‘:term:`dashboard`’, so you can see how many people use each service and where they get stuck, all reported in real time.

Services on the Performance Platform must show at least these 4 key performance indicators (KPIs):

- cost per transaction
- user satisfaction
- completion rate
- digital take-up

Each service should to measure additional KPIs based on their user and stakeholder needs. Service managers should use data to monitor, iterate and improve the service.

Public services must be on the Performance Platform and reporting their performance against 4 KPIs publically to pass the Digital Service Standard.
