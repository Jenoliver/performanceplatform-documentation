Performance platform documentation
##################################

The `performance platform <https://www.gov.uk/performance>`_ has dashboards for `about 100 government services <https://www.gov.uk/performance/services>`_. Dashboards help people who work on government services make decisions about how to improve them.

A dashboard can tell you:
=========================

- how much it costs each time someone uses the service (*cost per transaction*)
- how satisfied users were with the service (*user satisfaction*)
- where users need help, where they get stuck and what errors they encounter
- how many users use the service successfully and how many give up (*completion rate*)
- how many users use each 'channel' (online, phone, paper form, used to calculate your *digital take-up*)
- how long your web pages take to load and how reliable the servers are

We've got loads of new features planned, including:
===================================================

- an improved user satisfaction module, showing how your rating breaks down
- how long users take to complete your service and how long it takes for them to get what they applied for
- compare this week or month with the previous one â€“ find out the effect of your recent service improvements
- get an email if something needs attention (rest easy the rest of the time!)
- find out what content is most effective for getting users to your service
- dashboards for departments, agencies and groups of services

For more details, take a look at `our roadmap </roadmap>`_

Take a look at a few examples to get an idea of what we do:
