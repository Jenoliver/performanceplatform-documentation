The Performance Platform Manual
===============================

Central government in the UK handles over 1&frac12; billion transactions per year. We're using data to help improve them.

The [Performance Platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance) is a set of tools for finding out how your service is performing and how it can be improved. Take a look at a few examples to get an idea of what we do:

* [Carer's Allowance applications](https://www.gov.uk/performance/carers-allowance)
* [Lasting Power of Attorney registrations](https://www.gov.uk/performance/lasting-power-of-attorney)
* [Tax disc renewals](https://www.gov.uk/performance/tax-disc)

Several different apps make up the performance platform.

* **Collectors** take your data and feed it into the performance platform
* **Backdrop** stores data and lets you retrieve it using standardised commands
* **Spotlight** displays your data in a dashboard, using a range of module designs
