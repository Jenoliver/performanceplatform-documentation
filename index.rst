The Performance Platform is a set of tools that, together, allow you to monitor and visualise the performance of your digital services. At the core of the performance platform is a data store called Backdrop that stores your data and exposes a web API that allows it to be queried. This API can be used by Limelight to produce a variety of visualisations and modules to help understand the data.
