Stageprompt
===========

**StagePrompt** is a small javascript library for instrumenting a user journey
with an analytics provider (e.g. Google Analytics). The job of stage prompt is
to provide the 'glue code' for integrating the page with the analytics provider
allowing developers to easily record events such as *user loads page* or
*user opens inline help*.

The events which StagePrompt captures are stored by the analytics provider. For
example when integratin with Google Analytics events are sent using Google's
event tracking API: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/eventTrackerGuide.

For code and instructions on how to use StagePrompt see the Github repo and readme: https://github.com/alphagov/backdrop-send
