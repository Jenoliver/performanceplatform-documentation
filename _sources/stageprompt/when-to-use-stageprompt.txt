When the use StagePrompt
========================

Dependencies:

- An analytics service which provides event tracking (for example Google Analytics)
- jQuery

Considerations:

Stageprompt is designed to provide a basic level of user journey tracking and to
record this data in such a way that the Performance Platform can easily retreive
and intepret it.

It can be added to a site with minimal development effort. A javascript file must
be included on each page where it is used and the html of the user journey will
need to be tagged.

If a user journey has already been instrumented by an inhouse development team
then StagePrompt may not be required. If, however, a basic level of user journey
tracking is required then StagePropt is a good choice.
