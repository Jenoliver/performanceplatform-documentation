Performance Platform Documentation
==================================

New here? You probably :doc:`want to know what the Performance Platform is <overview>`.

Central government in the UK handles over 1Â½ billion transactions per year. We're using data to help improve them.

The `Performance Platform <https://www.gov.uk/performance>`_ is a set of tools
for finding out how your :term:`service` is performing and how it can be improved.
Take a look at a few examples to get an idea of what we do:

- `Carer's Allowance applications <https://www.gov.uk/performance/carers-allowance>`_
- `Lasting Power of Attorney registrations <https://www.gov.uk/performance/lasting-power-of-attorney>`_
- `Tax disc renewals <https://www.gov.uk/performance/tax-disc>`_
