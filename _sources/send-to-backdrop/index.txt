Send to Backdrop
================

**Send to Backdrop** is a wrapper around the Backdrop API that you can use to
get your data into the Performance Platform.

Things it will hopefully do include:

* Provide a simple way to consume your JSON and upload it
* Retrying sending the data if Backdrop returns an error
