Platform overview
#################

Government handles over one and a half billion transactions every year, allowing the exchange of information, money, permission, goods and services.

Ministers, senior officials, and staff at the centre of government rely on more automated, accessible, and actionable sets of data relating to the services government deliver.

Making data available simply and consistently allows users to see how services are performing and provides a consistent way to analyse information and drive improvements.

The `Performance Platform`_ is the way Government does this. The platform currently provides three views onto performance data:

-  `Transactions Explorer`_ - shows the number of transactions processed each year across government departments, agencies and other public bodies
-  `Services Dashboard`_ - displays detailed performance data on transactional services provided through `GOV.UK`_
-  `GOV.UK performance`_ - presents a dashboard of comparative data for the number of visitors to `GOV.UK`_ and the content they view information

There are more than 760 transactional services offered to citizens and organisations across government. At an operational level, management information is collected ‘in-house’ at a department level from many sources and processed across many systems.

The Performance Platform provides the single place where service performance metrics can be viewed in a consistent and authoritative way. 

The platform allows both realtime and non-realtime data to be brought together from these sources, combined and presented in a graphical form to allow rapid comparison between services against a common set of performance metrics and enable focussed decision making.
