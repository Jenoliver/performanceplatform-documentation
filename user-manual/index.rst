Performance platform user manual
################################

Welcome to the Performance Platform User Manual - designed to help government departments and agencies deliver service performance dashboards for their users.

The manual is divided into several sections, each covering different aspects of understanding, commissioning, using or delivering new dashboards on the Performance Platform.

- `Platform overview`_ - if you are new to the Performance Platform, this section introduces the platform, its features and how to use it.
- `Platform benefits`_ - presenting a consistent view of service performance metrics across government departments offers benefits to service users and managers and decision makers.
- `Performance metrics`_ - what are the measures that highlight how a service is performing.
- `Performance dashboards`_ - how does the Performance Platform display performance metrics.
- `Building a dashboard`_ - the process, activities and responsibilities necessary for the successful delivery of a new dashboard.
- `Developers`_ - technical detail necessary for developers to build and configure components necessary for the platform to operate, receive data from departments and present them on a dashboard.

The Performance Platform itself follows the `Government Service Design Manual`_ aligning to the `Design Principles`_ and meeting the `Digital by Default Service Standard`_.

There are a number of ways you can help improve the platform for yourself and other users by :ref: `Getting involved`_ .
