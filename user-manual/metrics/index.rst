The value of `using data <http://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement/using-data.html>`_ to direct improvements to service and the benefits of `measurement <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement>`_ of service performance is outlined in the `Government Service Design Manual <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual>`_.

Key performance indicators (KPI's)
==================================
Mandatory KPI's
---------------

The `Digital by Default Service Standard <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default>`_ identifies four `mandatory key performance indicators <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement/other-kpis.html>`_ (KPI's) as a minimum set of measures all new and changed services should monitor and report:

* `KPI: cost per transaction <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement/cost-per-transaction.html>`_
* `KPI: user satisfaction <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement/user-satisfaction.html>`_
* `KPI: completion rate <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement/completion-rate.html>`_
* `KPI: digital take-up <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup.html>`_

Other performance indicators
----------------------------

In addition to the mandatory KPI's, organisations are encouraged to provide additional performance indicators (PI's) relevant to the way users interact with the transactions offered as part of a service.

The Performance Platform recommends the presentation of a number of metrics based on existing Service Manager user need that can be incorporated into both service and service transaction dashboards:

* `Live service usage` - a real time indication of the number of active users on a particular service transaction
* `Transactions by channel` - a breakdown of user transaction volumes based on how they undertook the transaction - whether online, by telephone, post or other channels
* `Completion at each journey stage` - online service journeys are generally broken into a number of process stages.  This measure allows the inspection of how many users completed particular stage before completing the transaction
* `Page load time` - an indication of the time online users wait for pages to load before they can continue the transaction
* `Service uptime` - a measure of how available the service is to users

In addition to the above metrics, the platform team has identified a number of metrics that may notbe useful to all services, but useful for some:

* `site visits` - a measure of the total volumes of users visiting a site 
* `device usage` - an indicator of the type of device users use to access a service
* `browser usage` - an indicator of the browser technology users use to undertake transactions in
* `help usage` - a measure of the reliance users place on online help while trying to complete a transaction

Other metrics identified by service owners can be presented in graphical or tabular form dependent on need

Details of each metric and how it can be presented on a performance dashboard can be found following the links below:

Presenting metrics
==================

The Performance Platform provides a number of dashboard 'types' dependent on the needs of the service manager.  The primary dashboard type is the `transactional service` dashboard.

Metrics are displayed in `modules` within a dashboard.

Where metrics need to be aggragated across a number of `transactional` services to present an over-arching `organisational service` view of performance, a number of alternative dashboard templates can be used.

.. _cost per transaction: cost-per-transaction
.. _user satisfaction: user-satisfaction
.. _completion rate: completion-rate
.. _digital take-up: digital-take-up
.. _live service usage: live-service-usage
.. _transactions by channel: transactions-by-channel
.. _transaction volumes: transaction-volumes
.. _completion at each stage: completion-at-each-stage
.. _page load time: page-load-time
.. _service uptime: service-uptime
.. _site visits: site-visits
.. _device usage: usage-by-device
.. _browser usage: usage-by-browser
.. _help usage: help-usage
.. _bespoke: bespoke
