Case studies
############

To highlight how the platform can be used to develop performance dashboards 
a number of case studies have been produced to demonstrate to potential 
service managers and development teams how a dashboard is created.

THe case studies focus primarily on the preparation activities a department or 
agency must undertake prior to the delivery of the dashboard.

The studies follow the `Building a dashboard`_ process and make reference to 
specific parts of this manual to provide supporting information for any of the
stages and processes covered.
