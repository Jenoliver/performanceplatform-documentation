Service profile
***************
To be able to legally drive a particular type of vehicle on the road, individuals must first apply for a 
provisional licence (if not already covered), book and then pass both a theory and practical driving test.

The practical driving test service operated by the DVSA enables 
individuals to book, and if necessary check, change or cancel their test is headed up by service manager
Martin Richardson who is responsible for the efficiency and effectiveness of the service for his users.

The service is offered to individuals and businesses separately -- the key difference between the offerings
being businesses ability to manage block bookings as a single request.

The service currently handles approximately 1.8 million bookings and 800 thousand changes per year and cost £1.6 million
