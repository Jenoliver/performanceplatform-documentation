Platform benefits
#################

The Performance Platform is primarily built for `Service managers`_,
giving them a single place to see how their services are performing, how
people are accessing and using services, and to identify where they can
be improved.

The Performance Platform is open by design allowing individuals across
government, the public, businesses and other organisations access to the
same information. Allowing such broad overview and insight allows us to
understand how citizens use government services, focus where
improvements can be made and lead to higher levels of engagement and
improved user satisfaction and efficiency. The platform is a key tool in
governmentâ€™s commitment to transparency and open-data.

Being open, there is a requirement that any data the platform receives
and presents does not allow for the identification of any individual or
their personal details, or exposes any government or organisation
sensitive information. All data the platform receives must be
de-sensitised, anonymised and where required aggregated.

In broad terms, any data that would be made available for a Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) request is at a suitable level for presenting on
a publically accessible site.

The aim is to:

-  enable government to make **decisions** based on data
-  **automate** data collection, ending repetitive manual reporting
   efforts
-  do the hard work to make presentation and interpretation of data
   **simple** for users
-  be **open** to any government service supplying their data and
   customising their outputs, and **open** to the public
-  be **independent** of proprietary monitoring software
-  **provoke** rather than replace detailed analysis
